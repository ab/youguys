# Inclusive alternatives to "You Guys"

For decades, _guys_ has been used to address a mixed group of men and women.
It's increasingly viewed as a gender neutral plural.

But the singular _guy_ still has a strongly male inflection. Consider _that
guy_, or the _Python guy_. Do those sound like women? Not likely.

Even today when a group of _guys_ may be entirely female, it still can have a
sexist, male-as-default ring to it.
From [The Boston Globe in 2010](http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/03/21/hey_guys/?page=full):

> “You guys” may simply make some women feel overlooked or ignored, especially
> a single woman in a group being addressed as “you guys.” There’s a sense that
> even one man would short-circuit any attempt to address a group with “ladies”
> (except in a sarcastic-coach way), but a group made up of more than half
> women is easily addressed as “you guys.”

## What should I say instead?

There are [a lot of options](http://www.chicagonow.com/listing-beyond-forty/2017/05/40-gender-neutral-alternatives-to-saying-you-guys/).

**_Y'all_** is a fabulous all-purpose pronoun. It's great even if you're not a Southerner!<br>_Are y'all going to join youguys.club?_

**_Hey gang_** works well as a casual option.

**_Hi folks_** is a little more formal, but too folksy for some. **_Everyone_** sounds great with any audience.

Addressing the group by a label can also help, whether it's **_hi team_** or **_hey friends_**.
